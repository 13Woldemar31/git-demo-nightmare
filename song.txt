Took my first steps, and father held my hand,
Took my first steps, on my way to be a man!
Throughout this soil, with my first pair of shoes,
Throughout this soil, that I never want to loose!

My life is here, and here I wish to die,
This the place my fatherland!
My life is here, and here I wish to die,
This the place my fatherland!

Saw a face of an old dying man,
Learned to listen, to love my fatherland!
Life's a rumble, in sunshine, or in rain,
Whatever frozen, spring gives life again!
